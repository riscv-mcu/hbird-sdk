Overview
--------

In HummingBird SDK, we just provided applications which can
run in different boards without any changes in code to
demostrate the baremetal service, freertos service and
ucosii service features.

The provided applications can be divided into three categories:

* Bare-metal applications: Located in ``application/baremetal``

* FreeRTOS applications: Located in ``application/freertos``

* UCOSII applications: Located in ``application/ucosii``

If you want to develop your own application in HummingBird SDK, please click
:ref:`develop_appdev` to learn more about it.

The following applications are running using HummingBird board.

This `demo_plic application`_ is used to demostrate how to use
the PLIC API and Interrupt.

.. note::

    In this application's Makefile, we provided comments in Makefile about optimize
    for code size.

    If you want to optimize this application for code size, you can set the ``COMMON_FLAGS``
    variable to the following values, we recommend to use ``-Os -flto``.

demo_dsp
~~~~~~~~

This `demo_dsp application`_ is used to demostrate how to NMSIS-DSP API.

* Mainly show how we can use DSP library without dsp instructions and header files.
* It mainly demo the ``riscv_conv_xx`` functions and its reference functions

.. note::

    * For other HummingBird Processor Core based SoC, please check whether it has DSP
      feature enabled to decide which kind of **NMSIS-DSP** library to use.
    * Even our NMSIS-DSP library with DSP disabled are also optimized, so it can
      also provide good performance in some functions.

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and HummingBird SDK environment
    # cd to the demo_dsp directory

coremark
~~~~~~~~

This `coremark benchmark application`_ is used to run EEMBC CoreMark Software.

EEMBC CoreMark Software is a product of EEMBC and is provided under the terms of the
CoreMark License that is distributed with the official EEMBC COREMARK Software release.
If you received this EEMBC CoreMark Software without the accompanying CoreMark License,
you must discontinue use and download the official release from www.coremark.org.

In HummingBird SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``coremark`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in coremark application Makefile
to get different score number.

* By default, this application runs for 500 iterations, you can also change this in Makefile.
  e.g. Change this ``-DITERATIONS=500`` to value such as ``-DITERATIONS=5000``
* macro **PERFORMANCE_RUN=1** is defined
* **PFLOAT = 1** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print

.. note::

   * Since for each SoC platforms, the CPU frequency is different, so user need to change
     the ``ITERATIONS`` defined in Makefile to proper value to let the coremark run at least
     10 seconds
   * For example, for the ``HummingBird`` based boards supported in HummingBird SDK, we suggest
     to change ``-DITERATIONS=500`` to ``-DITERATIONS=5000``

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and HummingBird SDK environment
    # cd to the coremark directory
    cd application/baremetal/benchmark/coremark
    # Clean the application first

dhrystone
~~~~~~~~~

This `dhrystone benchmark application`_ is used to run DHRYSTONE Benchmark Software.

The Dhrystone benchmark program has become a popular benchmark for CPU/compiler performance measurement,
in particular in the area of minicomputers, workstations, PC's and microprocesors.

* It apparently satisfies a need for an easy-to-use integer benchmark;
* it gives a first performance indication which is more meaningful than MIPS numbers which,
  in their literal meaning (million instructions per second), cannot be used across different
  instruction sets (e.g. RISC vs. CISC).
* With the increasing use of the benchmark, it seems necessary to reconsider the benchmark and
  to check whether it can still fulfill this function.

In HummingBird SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``dhrystone`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in dhrystone application Makefile
to get different score number.

* **PFLOAT = 1** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print
* You can change ``Number_Of_Runs`` in ``dhry_1.c`` line 134 to increate or decrease
  number of iterations

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and HummingBird SDK environment
    # cd to the dhrystone directory
    cd application/baremetal/benchmark/dhrystone
    # Clean the application first

whetstone
~~~~~~~~~

This `whetstone benchmark application`_ is used to run C/C++ Whetstone Benchmark Software
(Single or Double Precision).

The Fortran Whetstone programs were the first general purpose benchmarks that set industry
standards of computer system performance. Whetstone programs also addressed the question
of the efficiency of different programming languages, an important issue not covered by
more contemporary standard benchmarks.

In HummingBird SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``whetstone`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in whetstone application Makefile
to get different score number.

* **PFLOAT = 1** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print
* Extra **LDFLAGS := -lm** is added in its Makefile to include the math library


**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and HummingBird SDK environment
    # cd to the whetstone directory
    cd application/baremetal/benchmark/whetstone

* 4 tasks are created
* 1 task is created first, and then create 3 other tasks and then suspend itself

In HummingBird SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``ucosii demo`` application.

* **RTOS = UCOSII** is added in its Makefile to include UCOSII service
* The **OS_TICKS_PER_SEC** in ``os_cfg.h`` is by default set to 200, you can change it
  to other number according to your requirement.

.. note:

   * For HummingBird SDK release > v0.2.2, the UCOSII source code is replaced using the
     version from https://github.com/SiliconLabs/uC-OS2/, and application development
     for UCOSII is also changed, the ``app_cfg.h``, ``os_cfg.h`` and ``app_hooks.c`` files
     are required in application source code.

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and HummingBird SDK environment
    # cd to the ucosii demo directory
    cd application/ucosii/demo
    # Clean the application first
    make SOC=hbird BOARD=hbird_eval CORE=e203 clean
    # Build and upload the application
    make SOC=hbird BOARD=hbird_eval CORE=e203 upload

**Expected output as below:**

.. code-block:: console

This `rt-thread demo application`_ is show basic rt-thread thread functions.

* main function is a pre-created thread by RT-Thread
* main thread will create 5 test threads using the same function ``thread_entry``

In HummingBird SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``rtthread demo`` application.

* **RTOS = RTThread** is added in its Makefile to include RT-Thread service
* The **RT_TICK_PER_SECOND** in ``rtconfig.h`` is by default set to `200`, you can change it
  to other number according to your requirement.


**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and HummingBird SDK environment
